# `esptouch`

Flutter plugin package which contain an API for ESP-TOUCH written in Dart combined with platform-specific implementation for Android using Java and iOS using Objective-C.

## Getting Started

## Development

1. Install Flutter.
    Follow the [official installation guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install). You can verify your installation by executing the following commands
    ```
    $ flutter --version
    $ flutter doctor
    ```
2. Configure your IDE
   * For Flutter and Dart code, you can use [Android Studio](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/tools/android-studio) or [Visual Studio Code](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/tools/vs-code).
   * To work with Android-specific code (`.gradle, .java`), use [Android Studio](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/tools/android-studio)
   * To work with iOS-specific code (`.m, .h`), use [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
3. Connect a real device
   Much of the plugin will not work in emulators and simulators, so you need real devices for development.
   ```
   flutter devices
   ```
4. Run example app

    1. Install packages `flutter packages get`
    2. Run the app `flutter run`. After some time, you should see the app open on your phone.

    

## Fundamentals
